For installing typescript you have to run the following command:
(npm install -g typescript)    // -g is the global flag it is neccessary it installs typescript globaly 

## Must install

### commands for compileing and executing your code

The command used to compile the code is as under
tsc ( and file name) 
The command used to execyte the code is as follows
node (and file name)

lets suppose my file name is main.ts so the command will be 
(tsc main.ts)
tsc main.ts // makes a javascript file and compiles the code from the typescript file to the java script file
the javascript file will be made of the same name but with .js extension in the end .
then we will run the command (node main.js) which will execute our code.
