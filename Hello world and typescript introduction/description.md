 # TYPESCRIPT 

   Typescript was developed by microsoft.Typescript is the super set of javascript . It is a programing language which comes with strict type checking . Typescript checks the error while writing the code unlike javascript which checks the errors on the run time. Still typescript is compiled in to javascript for it to run . typescript is also known as a synchronous thread like progaraming language.
   
## Installation

For installing typescript you have to run the following command:
(npm install -g typescript)    // -g is the global flag it is neccessary it installs typescript globaly 

## Must install
Make sure that you have intalled Vscode and node.js 

### commands for compiling and executing your code

The command used to compile the code is as under
tsc ( and file name) 
The command used to execyte the code is as follows
node (and file name)

lets suppose your file name is main.ts so the command will be 
(tsc main.ts)
tsc main.ts // makes a javascript file and compiles the code from the typescript file to the java script file
the javascript file will be made of the same name but with .js extension in the end .
then we will run the command (node main.js) which will execute our code.

# Hello world 
  hello world is a simple program which is created when ever we are starting to code in a new language. it is not copmulsory to do it but its just a tradition, in simple words, and its benificial that if we do it.
writing hello world in typescript is simple as compared to many languages. 
To write a hello wolrd program check out main.ts file.
