 # TYPESCRIPT 

   It was developed by microsoft .Typescript is the super set of javascript . It is a programing language which comes with strict
type checking . Typescript checks the error while writing the code unlike javascript which checks the errors on the run time.
Still typescript is compiled in to javascript for it to run .

for installing typescript you have to run the following command:
(npm install -g typescript)   // -g stands for global 

make sure that you have intalled Vscode 
 The commands used to compile the code are 
tsc ( and file name) 
node (and file name)

lets suppose my file name is main.ts so the command will be 
(tsc main.ts)
tsc main.ts // makes a javascript file and compiles the code from the typescript file to the java script file
the javascript file will be made of the same name but with .js extension in the end .
then we will run the command (node main.js) which will execute our code.
