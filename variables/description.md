# VARIABLES 
Variables in typescript are like containers that store data. 
### Example
we have all seen containers of salt, sugar and spices etc. In real life these containers sre storing some kind of eatable item in them. In typescript these containers are known as variables and the etable item is known as data

#### check out the main.ts file and see how to declare a variable

# Type inference
Type inference is the typescripts power to define the type of the variable by its value.
we get something like 
let message = "hello";
by hovering the cursor on the message we can see somethoing like let message:string
#### check the main.ts file
